# namche.ai Styleguide

Based on the Mycelia Brand System.

## Concept

namche.ai is the central hub for Jodok Batlogg's AI work.
Named after Namche Bazaar, the mountain town in Nepal that serves as the gateway to the Himalayas.

The brand combines Buddhist principles (without religiosity) with technology:
- Mindfulness
- Cause and effect
- Reduction of noise
- Clarity through simplicity

Visually, it follows the Mycelia principle: organic and technical forms merge.

## Logo

### Symbol

The logo symbol represents the letter "N," constructed on the Mycelia 3x3 block grid.

**Grid:**
- 3x3 blocks, block size X
- Gap between blocks: Y = X/8
- Total size: 26Y x 26Y (3X + 2Y)
- Clear space: minimum X + Y on each side

**Construction of "N":**
```
[Half-circle top] [empty         ] [Square       ]
[Square          ] [Quarter-circle] [Square       ]
[Square          ] [empty         ] [Half-circle bottom]
```

The left column forms the ascending stroke, the right the descending one.
The quarter-circle in the center connects the two strokes diagonally.
The half-circles at top-left and bottom-right provide organic endings.

### Logo with Type

- Font: Inter Bold
- Letter-spacing as defined in the Mycelia system
- Positioning per Mycelia rules (symbol left, type right, spacing X/8 * 5)

### App Icon

- Symbol on colored background (Primary/Full)
- Rounded corners (radius X)
- Favicon: shape/space ratio 1/4 instead of 1/8

## Composition

### Background Pattern

As in the Mycelia system: logo symbol in three sizes as background elements:
- Width of medium / 28 * 26
- Width of medium / 19 * 26
- Width of medium / 10 * 26

### Color Application

1. Choose a background color (e.g., Slate/Full)
2. Choose a pattern color from the opposite hue (e.g., Amber/Full)
3. Apply a linear gradient to the pattern (0% to 100% transparency)
4. Logo always in black or white

### Same level rule

Background and pattern always in the same level: e.g., Slate/Light + Amber/Light.

## Design Principles

- Clarity over decoration
- Generous whitespace
- High contrast between text and background
- Restraint in color: little, but deliberate
- No excess, no emojis, no pathos
